# Capacity Report

This is a reproducible measurement record for the production-oriented
reference topology. It is not a production certification or a universal
throughput claim.

## Benchmark environment

The deterministic benchmark runs locally with:

- the repository's Python 3.12 environment;
- deterministic embeddings, reranking, policy evaluation, and private
  in-memory workload state;
- no OpenAI, Ollama, external network, or provider credentials;
- configurable iterations and worker count.

Run it with:

```bash
make capacity-benchmark
make capacity-db-benchmark
make capacity-load
```

`capacity-db-benchmark` uses a temporary SQLite database by default. Set
`CAPACITY_DATABASE_URL` to a dedicated PostgreSQL benchmark database to measure
PostgreSQL. The database benchmark creates and removes only its private
`capacity_benchmark_effects` table; do not point it at an application database
without an approved maintenance window.

## Workloads

The benchmark covers:

1. Read-only customer inquiry.
2. RAG grounded response and grounding validation.
3. Confirmation-required pending operation.
4. Confirmed write receipt path.
5. Duplicate execution replay.
6. Fail-closed policy rejection.

The persistence workload additionally checks same-key concurrency, independent
keys, and tenant-labelled isolation inputs. It records p50, p95, p99, mean,
throughput, and bounded status counts.

## Current deterministic result

Run output is intentionally generated at validation time because latency is
machine-dependent. The acceptance invariants are:

- provider calls: `0`;
- same idempotency key: one business effect and one receipt;
- different keys: independent effects;
- policy rejection: denied;
- grounded response: citation-constrained and accepted by the existing
  validator.

Do not copy local latency numbers into a production SLO without recording the
hardware, database topology, workload mix, and versioned benchmark output.

## Measurement-only runtime metrics

The application exposes bounded duration histograms for:

- agent run;
- decision compilation;
- policy evaluation;
- confirmation validation;
- checkpoint persistence setup/write path;
- idempotency lookup;
- RAG retrieval;
- grounding validation.

Only durations, counts, statuses, and bounded categories are recorded. User
messages, prompts, customer data, tool arguments, tokens, and provider
responses are excluded.

## Bottlenecks and scaling recommendations

The likely scale-sensitive boundaries are shared PostgreSQL connections and
transactions, Qdrant retrieval capacity, checkpoint storage, evidence-store
latency, and telemetry export. The reference topology supports API
horizontal-scaling validation, but production sizing requires workload-specific
measurements.

- API horizontal scaling: supported when shared state and tenant context are
  configured correctly.
- PostgreSQL: tune pool size, transaction duration, indexes, and backup load.
- Qdrant: size indexes, replicas, and shard strategy for the corpus and query
  mix.
- Evidence storage: use immutable object storage with hash verification and
  retention controls.

## Limitations

The local benchmark does not represent managed cloud pricing, network latency,
provider latency, failure distributions, multi-region behavior, or a formal
SLO. Multi-replica tests remain environment-dependent and must be run against
the deployment topology intended for release.
